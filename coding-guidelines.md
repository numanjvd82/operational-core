# Coding Guidelines

### Getting Structured data from request
    - Use appurl for parsing the query params from the url.

### Don't use html injection using javascript:
    - The primary source of html will be the backend instead of injecting it from javascript.

### Manage Data Primarily from backend
    -  Manage data from backend whenever possible.
